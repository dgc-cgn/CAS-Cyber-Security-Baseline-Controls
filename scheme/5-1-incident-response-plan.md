# 5.1 Incident Response Plan

## 5.1.2.1 The organization shall have an incident response plan for how to respond to incidents of varying severity. If an organization is unable to manage some types of incidents on its own, the organization should have a plan for what it will do

## 5.1.2.2 The incident response plan shall detail who is responsible for handling incidents including any relevant contact information for communicating to external parties, stakeholders and regulators. The organization shall have an up-to-date hard copy version of this plan available for situations where soft copies are not available

## 5.1.2.3 The organization should consider purchasing a cyber security insurance policy that includes coverage for incident response and recovery activities or provide rationale for not purchasing one

## 5.1.2.4 The organization may use the incident response plan template (see Annex A) as a measure of satisfying Requirements contained in Subsection 5.1.2

### Information to collect

- A copy of the Incident Response Plan or information outlining the existence of an IRP and what is included.
- Description of incident response plan for various level of severity.
- If available, information regarding whether the company has purchased an insurance policy and possible rationale for not purchasing one.

### Collection method

Provided information may include:

- Documentation describing Incident Response Plan
- Completed IRP template from Annex A (found in the National Standard)
- Interview with auditor
- Completed Questionnaires

### Criteria Assessment

Auditors shall evaluate that:

- An Incident Response Plan (IRP) exists and addresses incidents ranging from trivial to extremely severe, including incidents that cannot be handled directly by the organization.
- The IRP outlines who is responsible for handling incidents including any relevant contact information for communicating to law enforcement, external parties, stakeholders and regulators.
- An up-to-date hard copy version of the IRP is available
- The organization considered purchasing or purchased a cyber security insurance policy.
  - Auditors to ask for rationale for not purchasing insurance, but do not need to evaluate.

### Additional Guidance

- The plan should cover the following incidents at a minimum: Data breach, Ransomware, and Interruption of services due to connectivity loss (e.g., distributed denial of service [DDOS]). For incidents to which the organization is unable to respond, the plan should describe what the organization will do (e.g., Consultant company X has agreed to provide its services to respond to incident Y).
- The organization should have a method to contact internal and external parties in the case of an incident.
